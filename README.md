A little fir tree was born in the forest. 
Children's christmas song.

1.The forest raised a Christmas tree,
 ‘Twas silent and serene
 In winter and in summer
 It was slender and  green. (2 times)
 
 2.The wind sang it a lullaby:
 Sleep Christmas tree, sleep tight!
 The snow was making clothes for it:
 It was a pretty sight! (2 times)
 
 3.A trembling bunny put himself
 Beneath its arms so wide;
 The hungry wolf just passed him by -
 A lovely place to hide! (2 times)
 
 4.Some sleigh bells rang throughout the woods,
 The snow was crisp and clean,
 A horsey brought a forester
 To hew that tree so green. (2 times)
 
 5.And now it comes to visit us,
 With lights and garlands bright,
 While all the children dance and sing
 To greet it with delight! (2 times)
